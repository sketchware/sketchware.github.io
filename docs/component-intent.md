### setFlags

The 'setFlags' block changes the behavior of an activity.

1. `SINGLE_TOP` — Organizes the views in a way that if the view you’re about to transition to was already called before, it would bring that view to the top rather than putting another copy on the top.

2. `CLEAR_TOP` - Clears all the previous views.
